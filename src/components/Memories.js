            Naveen, you are not just my brother, you are like a father to me. From childhood until now, I have always felt the absence of a father's presence in my life. But I never truly missed it‚Äîbecause you and amma have already given me everything I needed, even before I asked for it.
            <br /><br />
            I honestly don't know how to repay all that you both have done, but I promise you this ‚Äî one day, I will make both of you proud. Thank you for giving me so much freedom, for supporting me in every situation, and for always standing by my side no matter what I choose to do.
            <br /><br />
            I am not kidding, I genuinely have a deep respect for you. Sometimes I look at you and wonder how you carry all your responsibilities with such strength and grace. You are emotionally strong, mature, and responsible ‚Äî you inspire me every single day.
            <br /><br />
            Having you as a brother is one of the biggest blessings in my life. You are my role model, my guide, and my biggest supporter. I am so proud to call you my brother ‚ôæ
            <br /><br />
            Thanks for taking all the responsibility and handling everything with maturity ü´Ç This is just a small gesture of love from me ü´∂üèªü´Ç
            <br /><br />
            I know you have dreams too ‚Äî dreams you‚Äôve silently sacrificed to keep everything running. But I truly wish and pray that someday, you achieve everything you've ever hoped for. You deserve happiness, success, and peace more than anyone else I know. I‚Äôll always be by your side, cheering you on ‚Äî just like you‚Äôve done for me.
